# Machine Learning Portfolio
Welcome to my Machine Learning Portfolio repository! This repository showcases a collection of machine learning projects covering various domains and techniques, including image classification, time series forecasting, recommender systems, and deep neural networks.

## Purpose
The primary purpose of this repository is to serve as a portfolio, highlighting my expertise and experience in the field of machine learning. Each project provides a practical demonstration of machine learning concepts, algorithms, and their applications.

## Projects
Here's an overview of the types of projects you can find in this repository:

- *Image Classifier*: An image classification project where machine learning algorithms are used to classify images into predefined categories. This project demonstrates the power of supervised learning in solving image recognition problems.

- *Time Series Forecasts*: Time series forecasting is crucial in various industries. In this project, I explore different time series forecasting techniques to predict future values based on historical data.

- *Recommender Systems*: Recommender systems are widely used in e-commerce and content recommendation platforms. I've implemented a recommender system that suggests items or content to users based on their preferences and behavior.
